## Projects

### TV Control for Robert

We want to run a TV as an advertising screen on the computer floor. Idea is to use a Raspberry Pi to run slideshows on and has the facility for me to remote access from my desktop or laptop.

### Aircraft Tracker

Build a receiver to run Flightradar24's Pi24 client to track flights within 200-400 miles and automatically share data with Flightradar24. You can track flights directly off your Pi24 device.

### SSTV

Create a receiver and download images from the ISS.
For example, like this;

### Weather Station

Create a UTC Reading Weather Station that is constantly updating a page with the current weather and recording weather data for students to analyse.

### Astro Pi

Teams of young people design and program a scientific experiment to run on board the International Space Station.

### Can SAT

CanSat is an initiative of the European Space Agency that challenges students from all over Europe to build and launch a mini satellite the size of a soda can.

The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system, into the volume and shape of a soft drinks can. The CanSat is then launched by a rocket up to an altitude of approximately one kilometre, or dropped from a platform, drone or captive balloon. Then its mission begins. This involves carrying out a scientific experiment and/or a technology demonstration, achieving a safe landing, and analysing the data collected.

### Pi Wars

Being announced on 12th Sept

### Solar Powered BitCoin Mining

Bitcoin mining consumes 110 Terawatt Hours per year, which is 0.55% of global electricity production – that’s a ridiculous amount of energy. Using a Raspberry Pi with a PiJuice and Notecard Learn, you can create a solar-powered cryptocurrency “mining rig” with cloud-based reporting in a self-containing system. It’s not something that will make you rich, as the sheer computer power of a Raspberry Pi is not up to par with current crypto mining machines, but you’ll at least go to sleep with a good conscience.

Classroom Video calling kit?

Use Raspberry Pi to set up video / audio facilities so classes can be streamed if required …

### Air Quality Monitor(s)

Air quality is really something to think about, Especially in the classroom Thankfully, a Raspberry Pi with a Sensirion SPS30 sensor(?) or other sensors? can measure the air quality both indoors and out.

Just connect the particulate matter sensor to your Raspberry Pi and obtain easy-to-read graphs based on the read data.

### 3D Printed Laptop

Turning a Raspberry Pi into a proper laptop might sound like a complicated task. But actually, this project is not overly difficult for someone who has experience in soldering and project building. You’ll need a 3D printer of course, as well as a Raspberry Pi touch display, a Bluetooth keyboard, and an Arduino Uno.

### Hydrophonic Farm (Link with Gardening Enrichment?)

Are you interested in fresh green vegetables and herbs? The Robotic Urban Farm System is made from PVC pipes. It is relatively easy to build, and has some nice tricks up its sleeve. The vertical hydroponic garden allows for high-density yields and shorter growth cycles. A Raspberry Pi and an Arduino will help you to monitor temperature, water cycles, and plant nutrition. There’s even a smartphone app for this project.

### Smart Mirror

“Mirror, mirror on the wall…”, if you have a question, this smart mirror can answer them. With a growng list of compatible apps, MagicMirror² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into a personal assistant. The software is easy to configure and you can choose from a variety of different modules such as voice control, news, weather forecasts, transport, sports, and communication. The mirror can also be voice-activated.

### OpenCat

This open-source cat-shaped robot is nothing short of awesome. OpenCat is highly maneuverable; it can pose, crawl, balance, recover from falls, and detect obstacles. It can even stream videos and detect faces. You can also integrate Amazon’s Alexa personal assistant. The programmable and highly maneuverable robotic cat is a great project for advanced STEM education and AI-enhanced services. An Arduino takes responsibility for controlling detailed limb movements, while the Raspberry Pi 4 works as the cat’s brain.

### Mini-Tank

Inspired by the Mars rover, Perseverance, Mellow Fire began working on a small tank himself, a type of mini remote controlled tank. The initial prototype of 'Zippy' was no more than some motor on a 3D-printed body, controlled by wires plugged into battery, but over time his project grew more advanced.

The centre of the tank holds a Raspberry Pi Zero with a motor driver and the whole thing has been engineered to work with an Xbox controller. The code for the project is available on Mellow Fire's GitHub page.  Mellow Fire continued to develop Zippy (he got to Zippy 3.0), adding various bits such as a light and a camera, but eventually stopped as it was becoming too expensive. But it is a great example of letting your imagination run wild and taking a project from concept to reality at whatever pace you feel comfortable with.

### Christmas Tree Light Display

For this project, you'll need the Falcon Pi Player controller software installed and a USB drive to store songs and video the sequences. You'll also need a JST connector with 2 and 3 pins, screens, and a projector. Osprey22 also used a synthetic Christmas Tree, not a real one.

The project also requires some DIY as you'll need to house the Pi and its connectors in a box under your tree. This also supports the screens for your projected video. It's worth noting that this project might not be suitable for some homes and, given all the additional hardware you'll need, it's also a little on the expensive side.
